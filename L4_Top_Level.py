# This is a top level program used to help debug, control, and ultimately run the robot.
# The goal is to have multiple mini funcitons within this program that utilize other known libraries
# (such as the L2_speed_control.py as found in the SCUTTLE main github)
# most of these libraries will have to be imported if you did not do them on your own scuttle for lab

# please be very VERY precise with the comments you add


# keep global variables, may keep them local but global just in case for now
# ----- K definition below -----
#K is defined as a loop counter for having not detected a golfball. Ideally, we want a loop counter
# for this because it may misfire and not detect a golfball in one time instance, but would the next
#( say like 1ms later) so a time counter that iterates and if say like .5 seconds have passed with no 
#balls, then rotate
#------ end of K defition ---------
